this is the first README of recursion.
Recursion is the process by which a function calls itself. C language allows writing of such functions which call itself to solve complicated problems by breaking them down into simple and easy problems. These functions are known as recursive functions.

What is a Recursive Function in C?
A recursive function in C is a function that calls itself. A recursive function is used when a certain problem is defined in terms of itself. Although it involves iteration, using iterative approach to solve such problems can be tedious. Recursive approach provides a very concise solution to seemingly complex problems.
