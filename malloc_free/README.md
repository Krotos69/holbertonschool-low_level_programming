Dynamic memory allocation
#cisfun
Automatic allocation
When you declare variables or when you use strings within double quotes, the 
program is taking care of all the memory allocation. You do not have to think about 
it.

The malloc() function is a cornerstone of dynamic memory allocation in C. It stands for "memory allocation" and is used to request a block of memory from the heap.
